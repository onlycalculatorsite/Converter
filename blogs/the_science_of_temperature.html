    <p>
        Temperature is a fundamental physical quantity that expresses hot and cold. It is the manifestation of thermal energy, present in all matter, and is the source of the occurrence of heat, a flow of energy, when a body is in contact with another body at a different temperature. Understanding how to convert between different temperature scales is crucial in various scientific, industrial, and everyday applications worldwide.
    </p>

    <h2>The Three Main Temperature Scales</h2>
    <p>
        While many temperature scales have existed throughout history, three are most commonly used today:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Celsius (°C):</b> Named after Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, this scale is widely used globally for general purposes. Water freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C at standard atmospheric pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Fahrenheit (°F):</b> Named after German physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, this scale is primarily used in the United States. Water freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F at standard atmospheric pressure.</li>
        <li><b>Kelvin (K):</b> This is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. It's the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI) and is widely used in scientific fields. 0 Kelvin (absolute zero) is the theoretical point at which all molecular motion stops. There are no "degrees" in Kelvin; temperatures are simply referred to as "kelvins."</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conversion Formulas</h2>
    <p>The relationships between these scales are defined by specific formulas:</p>

    <h3>Celsius to Fahrenheit:</h3>
    <p>
        °F = (°C × 9/5) + 32
        <br><i>Example:</i> 25°C to Fahrenheit: (25 × 9/5) + 32 = 45 + 32 = 77°F
    </p>

    <h3>Fahrenheit to Celsius:</h3>
    <p>
        °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9
        <br><i>Example:</i> 77°F to Celsius: (77 - 32) × 5/9 = 45 × 5/9 = 25°C
    </p>

    <h3>Celsius to Kelvin:</h3>
    <p>
        K = °C + 273.15
        <br><i>Example:</i> 0°C to Kelvin: 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 K
    </p>

    <h3>Kelvin to Celsius:</h3>
    <p>
        °C = K - 273.15
        <br><i>Example:</i> 300 K to Celsius: 300 - 273.15 = 26.85°C
    </p>

    <h3>Fahrenheit to Kelvin:</h3>
    <p>
        First convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, then Celsius to Kelvin.
        <br>K = ((°F - 32) × 5/9) + 273.15
        <br><i>Example:</i> 68°F to Kelvin: ((68 - 32) × 5/9) + 273.15 = (36 × 5/9) + 273.15 = 20 + 273.15 = 293.15 K
    </p>

    <h2>The Importance of Accurate Conversions</h2>
    <p>
        Accurate temperature conversions are vital in many fields:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Science and Research:</b> Experiments often require precise temperatures, and data might need to be standardized to Kelvin for thermodynamic calculations.</li>
        <li><b>Manufacturing and Industry:</b> Industrial processes, material properties, and quality control depend heavily on exact temperature measurements.</li>
        <li><b>Medicine and Healthcare:</b> Body temperature monitoring and pharmaceutical storage require accurate conversions to ensure patient safety and product efficacy.</li>
        <li><b>International Communication:</b> Bridging temperature information in weather reports, cooking recipes, and product specifications across different regions of the world.</li>
    </ul>
