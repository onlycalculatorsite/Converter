        In today's globalized world, understanding currency exchange rates is more important than ever. Whether you're traveling abroad, investing internationally, or making online purchases from a foreign vendor, knowing how currencies are valued against each other is key to making informed financial decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What are Exchange Rates?</h2>
    <p>
        An exchange rate is simply the value of one country's currency in terms of another currency. For example, if the USD to EUR exchange rate is 0.92, it means 1 US Dollar is equivalent to 0.92 Euros. These rates are constantly fluctuating due to a variety of factors.
    </p>

    <h2>Factors Influencing Exchange Rates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Interest Rates:</b> Higher interest rates can attract foreign investment, increasing demand for a currency and thus its value.</li>
        <li><b>Inflation:</b> Countries with lower inflation rates tend to have stronger currencies.</li>
        <li><b>Economic Stability:</b> Political and economic stability make a country's currency more attractive to investors.</li>
        <li><b>Balance of Payments:</b> A country's trade balance (exports vs. imports) can significantly impact its currency.</li>
        <li><b>Government Debt:</b> High public debt can make a country less attractive to foreign investors, weakening its currency.</li>
        <li><b>Speculation:</b> Currency traders' expectations about future exchange rates can create self-fulfilling prophecies.</li>
    </ul>
